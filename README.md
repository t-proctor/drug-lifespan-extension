# Drug Lifespan Extension Project

This project analyzes the DrugAge database to explore the relationship between various drug compounds and their effects on lifespan in different species.

## Project Structure

- `data/raw/`: Contains the original raw data (`drugage.csv`, `Dosage_Pattern_Summary.csv`).
- `data/processed/`: Contains intermediate or final processed data files (e.g., `processed_drugage.pkl`).
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- `reports/figures/`: Generated plots and figures.
- `src/`: Source code for data processing (`data_processing.py`), visualization (`visualization.py`), and potential future modeling.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Usage

1.  Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2.  Run data processing: `python src/data_processing.py`
3.  Run visualization: `python src/visualization.py`

(Add more details about modeling, results, etc. as the project progresses)
